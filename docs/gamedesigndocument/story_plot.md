I wake up after a sudden movement. I can notice someone is shaking me and asking me to wake up. When I open my eyes, I see a small, funny-looking man, smiling at me. He seemed surprised I finally woke up. Suddenly, I notice a piercing pain striking in my head. What is going on? I look around me and all I see are trees. My pockets are empty and I’m covered in leaves and dirt.

It seems like this stranger is also confused about what is happening. I ask him who he is, and he answers that his name is Tyhma. For some reason, his name and his round face seem familiar, but I can’t remember meeting him. He asks about me, and I tell him my name is Toisto. After saying my name, I realize that I don’t remember anything else about me. My mind is completely wiped out. 

Tyhma makes sure I’m alright, and recommends us to get out of the woods, since it can be dangerous due to the monsters roaming around. We find a dirt path with a wooden sign where the direction to Laventeli is pointed out. I remember I used to go to that town when I was a kid, I know there is good food and shelter. So we walk towards the town.

After walking for a while, we hear a strange sound coming from the bushes near the trees. All of a sudden, a small monster appears in front of us, threatening us. We have two options, whether fleeing or fighting it, but something inside me is telling me that I should not run away. We get into a battle.

Case 1 (Wizard): I feel a great power inside me that needs to come out. I open my mouth and strange words that seem like Latin burst out. What am I saying? It seems like it’s damaging the monster, so I continue.

Case 2 (Warrior): An instinct inside me is telling me to grab a tree branch and fight this monster down with powerful attacks. While doing it, I can feel a rush of adrenaline through my veins. I know I was born to do this.

Case 3 (Archer): I notice a small but sharp stone on the ground. I grab it without thinking, aim for the monster’s head and execute a perfectly accurate shot. My aim is out of this world, how can I be so good? I realize this is not the first time I’ve done this.

After the attack, the little monster runs towards the bushes crying. I feel stronger and more powerful, like if I just levelled up. Tyhma, who was hiding behind a tree, witnessed it all. He comes towards me and tells me I have raw talent and that I should dedicate my life to monster hunting. He proposes to be our second hand in this adventure, to which I agree. It may be useful to have a companion. 

Suddenly, we can hear a low but scary growl coming from the same bushes. It might be that same creature from before, we prepare ourselves for a second round. Why would it come back after crushing him in the fight?

A huge monster leaps out of the bushes. It seems like it’s that tiny monster’s mom, and she looks very angry at us. Tyhmaautomatically whips out his rusty-looking slingshot and shoots a pebble at the huge monster, which lands right in front of her. What a lame shot. There was an awkward silence and then the creature roars. It was so loud that even the trees started to tremble in fear. Tyhma and I looked at each other, and without saying a word, started sprinting towards Laventeli. 

After running for what it seems like an eternity, we finally get to the town. It’s just like I remembered it. Due to that exhausting encounter with the creatures, we agree on going to the local tavern to get a drink, or two. On our way to the tavern, I stumble upon a diary with no name on it. When we open it, we see there is nothing relevant. I decide to keep it either way, it seems important. When we get into the tavern, we speak to the bartender. He gives us our drinks and then asks us if we are here again for the bounty for killing the skeletons at the graveyard. What does he mean “again”? We accept this quest since we could use the money to get better gear. He tells us where the cemetery is. 

On our way out, we notice there is a blacksmith, and Tyhma suggests we should check it out. We see he has a big variety of weapons and armor. The blacksmith seems to recognize us and asks if we lost our gear again. What does he mean “again”? He gladly gives us a sword/bow and arrows/spells book and a better slingshot. We are now ready to get that bounty, so we decide to make our way towards the graveyard.

Once we reach our destination we see several *skeletons* roaming around. They seem like a bigger threat than the tiny monster from before.

I realize that fighting has always been a part of my life, it seems natural to go into battle with these skeletons. Tyhma and I head towards the first enemy.

…

After slaying all of the enemies, we notice another skeleton coming out of the sewers. We approach it and defeat it, and notice that the monsters come from there. Tyhma, excited, mentions the huge amount of money we would get if we slayed all of the monsters in the sewers. So we approach the entrance.

While trying to get in, we notice that the entrance door has a quite interesting keyhole. Tyhma tells us that he remembers seeing a key that would fit back in the smithy. Maybe we could use this bounty to buy this key. It’s a good investment.

We go to the tavern to get our money from the bounty. The bartender tells us that, thanks to our bravery, killing monsters will automatically give us some coins. Then we headed to the smithy to buy the key. The blacksmith notices that we have no money and offers us a quest, which involves going to the forest to gather some wood for him. He gives us his axe.

…

We go to the graveyard to get into the sewers since we now have the key to open the door. When we try to open it, we notice that the key fits but doesn’t turn. Tyhma says that it seems like the dead took the solution to the grave. It looks like we have to solve some sort of puzzle by interacting with the graves.

After solving the puzzle we sneak into the sewers. Once inside, we see that it looks like a labyrinth. It’s full of monsters and creepy rooms. The bright side is that it’s filled with loot. After investigating a couple of rooms and slaying some monsters, a sneaky creature creeps up and kidnaps Tyhma. My quest is to save him! I follow the trail that the monster left behind until I see poor Tyhma in a cage. 

There is a puzzle to free him but I must be careful with the guard.

After getting Tyhma we roam around the sewers for a big longer and we find a mysterious looking door guarded by a huge monster. It seems like a boss. 

Case 1: We are strong enough to fight it.

Case 2: We need more experience or better gear to fight it.

…

Once we are able to fight it, we go into battle with it. It takes a lot of strength but we finally defeat it.  We go into the room. It is so familiar. We look around, find objects that I know belong to me but I don’t understand how, until I see a painting on the wall of myself and Tyhma, but we are not quite ourselves. I get flashbacks of my previous life, before this amnesia. I remember that I am the bad guy of the story, and Tyhma is my wingman. I feel my heart being divided between good and evil. I feel like I am getting into combat with my evil self. It finally takes over me. The evil always wins. I am myself again.

I remember my purpose now, and it is to find the gem in the woods that will grant me infinite power. That way I’ll be able to dominate the world. I’m afraid I’ll lose my memory again. Maybe I should write somewhere down who I really am.

We get out of the dungeon through the cemetery, go through the town to run back to the forest. While running, I feel like my valuables are falling off my pockets, including my diary, but I don’t care. I must fulfill my mission. As Tyhma and I run through the woods we can feel the adrenaline since we are so close to the gem. We suddenly hear a loud crack. We look up and see a huge tree branch falling on our heads. Everything turns black.
…

Case 1: We haven’t written down who we are. The story repeats itself. 

Case 2: We have written down who we are. The story goes on.

It says: “If you are reading this right now and you do not know who you are, remember your purpose, you are the villain. Go get that gem.” Suddenly, all of the memories come back and I know exactly who I am. I know that I need to turn back to the woods and get the gem. 

While running back a huge tree branch falls right in front of us, that was very close. We reach the location where the gem is at and notice that we need to solve a puzzle in order to obtain it.

Finally, the gem is released from the stone and I feel an infinite source of power within me. It is my time to rule the world.

THE END

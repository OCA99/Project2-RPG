# About the game
*UnderEvil* is a game about a girl named Toisto who wakes up in the middle of the woods near a small town without any memory. As she is walking, she stumbles across a familiar face, a boy named Thyma. All together they decide to start working as monster hunters to help the town people and stop the rising population of monsters from the cementary. But, where do they come from? Why are they there? 
Help them discover the dark secret that the town holds and the reason why they can't remember who they are. Will you be able to uncover the mystery?
